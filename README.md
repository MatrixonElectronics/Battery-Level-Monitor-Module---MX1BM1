# Battery-Level-Monitor-Module---MX1BM1
The MX1BM1 - Battery Level Monitor Module is a compact, low-power board designed to measure battery voltage. It safely scales battery voltages (3.0V to 5.2V) for ADC input on MCUs like ESP32, STM32, Arduino, etc. It features an enable-controlled voltage divider with MOSFET gating for low standby current, ideal for deep-sleep applications.
