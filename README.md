# Battery Level Monitor Module MX1BM1

# Overview: 
The [ MX1BM1 - Battery Level Monitor Module ](https://payhip.com/b/CDjuW) is a compact, low-power board designed to measure battery voltage. It safely scales battery voltages (3.0V to 5.2V) for ADC input on MCUs like ESP32, STM32, Arduino, etc. It features an enable-controlled voltage divider with MOSFET gating for low standby current, ideal for deep-sleep applications.

# Key Features:
- Input voltage: 3.0V to 5.2V (VBAT)
- Output: Scaled analog voltage for 3.3V ADCs
- Enable-controlled voltage divider (low-power)
- 10ÂµF smoothing capacitor for clean ADC readings
- Standard 2.54mm 4-pin header for easy integration
- Breadboard-friendly and compact

# Applications
- Battery-powered IoT devices
- Remote sensor nodes
- Device battery level reporting
- Low-voltage cut-off / battery protection systems
- USB power diagnostics
- Smart wearables and embedded systems
